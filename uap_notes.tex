processing midi input:

read midi

coalesce ticks across all voices
somewhat manually pick out top voice

find sheet music and write true values

figuring out parameters:

manually figure out tempo
fully supervised/semi supervised for true values

run algorithm:

run normal algorithm
if two with similar probabilities, play both?

run normal algorithm
keep track of the least probable points

need a way to constrain things

playback:
play back ticks generated at mean tempo
visualize as line plot or something
compare to true values visually + audio
