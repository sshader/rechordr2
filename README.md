# rechordr2

static.py and inference.py contain code corresponding to the Dynamic Bar Pointer Model from Bayesian Modelling of Temporal Structure in Musical Audio (Whitley, Cemgil, Godsill)

sample.py contains code to play back a rhythm (basically just a note sequencer)
needs the fluid synth file in data/ to work (too big for github)
